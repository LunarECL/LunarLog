**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
A clear description of the problem. e.g. "I need to send logs to X but there's no sink for it."

**Describe the solution you'd like**
What you want to happen. Include API sketches if you have them:

```cpp
// Example of the API you'd like to see
logger.writeTo<MySink>("name", ...);
```

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Other approaches you've thought about and why they don't fully solve the problem.

**Additional context**
- Which formatters/sinks/features does this relate to?
- Are there examples from other logging libraries that do this well?
